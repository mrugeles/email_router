Task to complete in this workflow, workflow prompt = What would the development tasks for this product be?

Defining workflow steps from the workflow prompt

Executing step: Development tasks for a product are the engineering work required to develop the product. To identify the development tasks, you would typically need to break down each user story into specific tasks. Each task should be actionable and contribute to the completion of the story. The tasks can include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and any other necessary steps to implement the functionality described in the user stories.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into specific tasks that are actionable and contribute to the completion of the story. Tasks can include coding, testing, design, documentation, and any other necessary steps to implement the functionality described in the user stories.
Worker Agent Response:

Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The answer provided does not meet the specific structure outlined in the criteria. The structure requires specific elements such as Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies, none of which are present in the given answer.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
Please include the following elements in your answer: Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement
